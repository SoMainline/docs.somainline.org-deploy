Open Source Hardware Documentation
----------------------------------

This repository is a place for all the knowledge about our SoCs and devices that we managed to discover through the porting process.

Contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We strive to bring a community-founded hardware documentation for all devices. The knowledge is out there, scattered over various places like downstream kernel sources. This repository's purpose is to gather all of this data in one place, so as to make it easily accessible. We want to proceed these efforts with all due respect to hardware vendors' intellectual property.
By adding data to the knowledge base, you agree:

* the knowledge you submit comes from a publicly available source (and not confidential documents),
* the knowledge has been obtained legally,
* the data you submit is factually accurate,
* that if the data in question is a register dump, magic sequence or a different non-open-coded information, you provide a way to reproduce the dump.
